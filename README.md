# Landing Page Project

# Project Name

This project is a website landing page that began as a static HTML page, with some pre-styed CSS.  Assignment was to manipulate the landing page and add functionality to the user experience using the Document Object Model and JavaScript.  DOM manipulation is the process of interacting with the DOM API to change or modify the HTML document that is displayed in the browser. The document can be changed to add or remove elements, update existing elements, rearrange existing elements, update the data in a web page without refreshing the page, change the overall layout of the page and respond to the user based on their behavior. Examples of DOM Manipulation in this project include:

## Features
- [Feature 1]: Website features a beautiful hot air balloon animation that is triggered by the user scrolling down the page. As the user scrolls past four main sections, each section is highlighted by the continuing parallax animation occuring in the background.
- [Feature 2]: Navigation is built dynamically using JavaScript and DOM manipulation commands (append, appendChild, innerHTML)
- [Feature 3]: Section Active State based on the viewport, section and event. 
- [Feature 4]: Scroll to anchor utilizing appropriate event Listener functionality and javascript methods
